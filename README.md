## **Generator 1:** what does this generate?

It genrerates pixar lamps on top of the letter I

## What are the most important and interesting qualities of this kind of thing?

The overall bounce and the spring of the I when the lamp jumps on it is the part that was modified

## List your 5+ sliders. Describe what each one controls, and why that is relevant to this

["size", "aspectRatio", "angle", "hue", "brightness", "jump"]
I need size/as to control how i want the I and the lamp to interact.
I need andle and hue to make the lamp light more interesting and dance to music.
Jump is for the lamp to jump :D

## List your 5+ landmarks. How are they different from each other?

squish, jump, disappearing_I, kick, stand
These are all poses that the lamp and I can make that I thought were cool

## For a generator of this type of thing, what kinds of things _can't_ it generate?

It cante generate dynamic lamps because that would be weird and too hard for me to imagine

## What was hard or easy about making this generator? How did your plans change?

The constraints made it easy. The math of making the lamp move was by far the hardest part

## **Generator 2:** what does this generate?

Letters of various letters

## What are the most important and interesting qualities of this kind of thing?

It changes letter with the slider, so the user can spell things if they so choose.

## List your 5+ sliders. Describe what each one controls, and why that is relevant to this

["size", "aspectRatio", "angle", "hue", "brightness", "letter"]
Size/AS/angle control the box shape of the letter to dance
hue/brightness are made to make the colors pop
letter is the user input of the generator to make it more fun

## List your 5+ landmarks. How are they different from each other?

big_random_on_reload: [1, 1, 0.5, 0.5, 0.64, random]small_random_on_reload: [0.2, random, 0.04, 0.64, 0.35, random],
big_G: [1, 0.78, 0.8, 0.76, 0.24, 0.24],
mean_t: [0.81, 0.74, 0.04, 0.0, 0.35, 0.72],
ooooo: [0.04, 0.38, 0.8, 0.06, 0.64, 0.54],

They are all different letters with user variance. Some use randomization with a random letter that loads on reload, and many use different letters and give them different personalities

## For a generator of this type of thing, what kinds of things _can't_ it generate?

It cant create a new random letter on every click, although i tried.

## What was hard or easy about making this generator? How did your plans change?

Getting the math to work out and using rules to find out how generators work in general was the main problem

## Which generator has a more interesting possibility space?

The Letters have the most posibilities but the lamps is much more fun in my opinion

## List any resources (code, images, etc) you've used, and where you got them from

## List any help you got from classmates or websites, so that you can remember it for later
